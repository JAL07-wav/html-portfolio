<h1>The Best Animes According to Adrian</h1>
<h2>Top 3 Anime of All Time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>One Piece</h3>

<p>Binge-watching this show during the pandemic got me immersed and hooked up due to its exciting worldbuilding and character storylines. Haki and devil fruits are one of the most creative power system in animes</p>
<h3>Hunter x Hunter</h3>

<p>Same with One Piece, its worldbuilding is exhilarating. One thing that stands out about this anime is how well-thought of and balanced, the power system of this anime.</p>
<h3>Naruto</h3>

<p>Childhood classic. Arguably the most interesting power system out of the three due to its 'cool factor'. Who wouldn't want to have a sharinggan in real life? Or what kid would like to imagine they are casting chidori or rasengan?</p>
